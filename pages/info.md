*elmo* is a first take on both development in Haskell and structured overlay networks for me. I read some papers about possible ways to achieve the same services as a centrally controlled one, with just the techniques of distributed computing. This will be a learning experience for me and a proof-of-concept at the same time.

## I got inspired by...

[Michael Rose][1] and his fabulous [themes for jekyll][2]. Authors of [A List Apart][4] and [Smashing Magazine][5] since 2002. [GitHub][6] and how they built such a habitat for cooperation worldwide. [Automattic][3] and how they built a fantastic community around WordPress. And many, many more...

Please make *Feeling Responsive* yours and if you like it, please link back to my homebase <a href="http://phlow.de/">Phlow</a>. That would be awesome.

#### Since then, fork it!

Yours sincerelly, [Moritz »mo.« Sauer][7]
